# Mintlify Clone - Documentation Landing Page

A high-fidelity recreation of the Mintlify landing page and documentation UI. This project focuses on a "hybrid" layout that blends a marketing hero section with a functional, three-column documentation interface.

## 🚀 Recreated Sections

The following components were built from scratch using semantic HTML5 and modern CSS:

* Global Navigation: A dark-themed sticky navbar with integrated "Call to Action" buttons.
* Interactive Hero Section: A deep-teal marketing section featuring a "NEW" product badge, blurred background glow effects (using CSS pseudo-elements), and a centered email capture form.
* Overlapping Docs Preview: A layered UI technique where the documentation interface overlaps the hero section using negative margins and high z-index.
* Three-Column Documentation Layout:
    * **Left Sidebar:** Navigation links with active state styling and icons.
    * **Main Content:** A clean documentation area featuring breadcrumbs, tabs, a search bar with a keyboard shortcut indicator (`⌘K`), and an "Ask AI" button.
    * **Right Sidebar:** A "Table of Contents" (TOC) with a vertical border-left indicator for the active section.
* **Responsive Card Grid:** A 2-column grid system for "Quickstart" guides with hover-state transitions.

## 🎨 Design System

### Fonts
* **Primary Font:** Inter / System Sans-Serif stack (`-apple-system`, `BlinkMacSystemFont`, `Segoe UI`).
